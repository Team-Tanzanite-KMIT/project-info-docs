## Developing a Blockchain-Based eVault for Legal Records
The objective of this project is to develop a blockchain-based eVault system for legal records that can ensure security, transparency, and accessibility for all stakeholders.
The system should be able to store, manage, and share legal records securely and efficiently.


## Requirements: 
1. The eVault system is based on a blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric: A permissioned blockchain framework supporting modular architecture and private channels for confidentiality.
2. The system has user-friendly interfaces for lawyers, judges,and, clients to interact with the eVault, with features such as uploading and retrieving documents, tracking changes, and sharing information.
3. The system  ensures the privacy and confidentiality of legal records.

   
## Expected Outcomes: 
A functional prototype of the blockchain-based eVault system for legal records, with a user-friendly interface and features such as document upload, retrieval, and sharing.
A detailed design document outlining the architecture, features, and technical specifications of the eVault system.


## Impact: 
The development of a blockchain-based eVault system for legal records can have a significant impact on improving access to justice in India. It can lead to faster, more efficient court proceedings, reduced costs, and increased trust in the justice system. Moreover, it can provide a secure and transparent platform for storing and sharing legal records, making it easier for clients to access their own records and for lawyers to access relevant case information.


## Why Hyperledger Fabric?
Hyperledger stands out due to its modular architecture, providng greater flexibility and customisation options. It incorparates security features such as permissioned access, encryption, and authentication mechanisms. It allows you to create a private and permissioned blockchain network which is beneficial for legal records, as it enables fine-grained control over who can participate and access data.

The Linux Foundaton hosts this global collaboration, which comprises professionals in finance, banking, the IOT, supply chains, manufacturing and technology.

Strengths:
1. Permissioned network design suitable for private legal records
2. Modular and flexible architecture for customising components.
3. Support for various consensus mechanisms.
4. Strong focus on enterprise use cases and integration.
5. Chain code using various programming languages

Considerations:

• Requires a good understanding of blockchain concepts and enterprisearchitecture.

• Might require more development effort compared to public blockchains.

• May have a steeper learning curve for newcomers.



Chaincode in Hyperledger is used for smart contracts that defines the logic of decentralised applications running on it. 


Layers of HyperLedger:

Organizational structure of hyperledger technology:


API (Application
Programming Interface ), SDK(Software Development Kit) , CLI(Command
Line Interface)


API includes
membership services such as a set of cryptographic certificates,
signifies that peer belongs to the same organisation and
communication between peers f same membership services.


SDK includes
blockchain and transaction layer which constitutes the core code of
the blockchain, consist of consensus algorithm and peer-to-peer
protocol.


CLI includes
membership services which consists of chaincode and logic to run in
operaton on the hyperledger.
